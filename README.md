# MarkerBasedAR_HandsOn
Made marker-based AR of Barbarian animation model using Vuforia Engine in Unity

1. Installed Vuforia engine through package manager by Downloading Vuforia package from Vuforia developer site.
2. Created Vuforia license for basic usage.
3. Created database for vuforia markers.
4. Added Hiro marker (as I have black and white printer in my house), Hiro was easier to print in the database as marker image. Inspected the feature points and checked it was augumentable (had rating 4/5 for this image.)
5. Downloaded the database as unity package and imported into the unity project.
6. Added AR camera from Vuforia engine
7. Created Image Target and pointed out the marker image I added in the database.
8. Imported the barbarian model and checked if materials are assigned property and set the animation that I wanted.
9. Placed the barbarian on the marker position and scaled it to appear reasonably bigger in AR scene, and added the model as child object to image target.
10. Tested with webcam from game engine
11. Created APK file and ran in Android machine
